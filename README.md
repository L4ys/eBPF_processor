# eBPF IDA Proc

This is an IDA Processor that can be used to disassemble eBPF bytecode. It was
originally developed for a challenge, but since expanded and updated. It still
needs testing against more eBPF ELF files and comparison with output from other
tools like eBPF-supporting objdump, and bpftool.

## Requirements

Currently IDA 7.4 using Python3 is necessary.
