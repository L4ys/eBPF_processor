# IDA Python script to annotate all references to maps
# with a comment of the map name.
#
# requires pyelftools, since that does all the ELF parsing for us
#
# Also requires the eBPF ELF file to examine directly

# general strategy: parse ELF to determine relocation info & locations,
# replicate how IDA maps sections to addresses, use this replicated
# loading/addressing to add drefs (ida_xref.add_dref) from each
# relocated location (an instruction) to a defined map.
#
# Then, add repeatable comments on each defined map. This should at least
# cause those repeatable comments to appear alongside instructions which
# have relocations applied to them for those particular maps
